# My library of papers

Everytime I read a paper, I almost instantly forget what it was about the next week. This web app allows me to upload summaries and comments that I have for the papers I read, in a single place. 

# A compressed summary 

After I read a paper, I like to write down the answer to four questions: 

- *Why is this work imporant?* This gives me a sense of the application of the paper and why it is important. It helps me put things into context and understand the rest of the content of the paper better. 
- *Why is this work different?* The answer to this question tells me what is new or different about the method proposed by the authors, when comparing against the rest of the current literature. 
- *How does it work?* This answer delves into some of the technical details of the paper, although it still tries to avoid the nitty-gritty and still gives the big picture idea. 
- *What are the results?* This provides any interesting or significant results that are particularly important. Any additional comments or thoughts I have would be written as well. 

I use the four questions, and their answers, whenever I need to go back to a paper to refresh my memory and what it proposes and how it does it. This web app allows me to store all of these summaries in a single place.
